The Land Use Map Viewer is one of the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) interactive mapping and analysis sites, showing land use data.

Use this site to explore existing and future land use.

The MAG Land Use Maps viewer allows the user to graphically view land use data for all areas of Maricopa County, Arizona.  The viewer provides interactive mapping and reporting tools to allow exploration of the MAG existing and future land use datasets.  The existing land use dataset is created by integrating GIS datasets from a variety of sources including the Maricopa County Assessor's Office, Arizona State Trust and Federal ownership.  The future land use dataset is created by overriding areas with developable land uses (e.g. vacant agriculture) with anticipated land uses prescribed within municipal developments and general plans.

This JavaScript web app viewer was developed by MAG staff for MAG member agencies and the public using ESRI's JavaScript API.
